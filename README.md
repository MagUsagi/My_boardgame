# My Boardgame App
My Boardgame is an application built using Django to manage your own board games. 
Each boardgame detail page displays images, number of players, playing time, notes, and game history.
## Features
• A more complex and practical application that expands on the memo application I learned as an introduction to Django, including creating, editing, and deleting.  
• Game Play Records: When data is submitted via POST request, both History Forms (date, duration) and Record Form Sets (players, scores, wins/losses) are validated and stored.  
• Flexible and user-friendly design using Bootstrap as the web framework.  
## Next Development
• User registration function and analysis to calculate win rate, frequency of play.  
• Function to register and view photos taken at the time of play in the records database.  
• Function to create a score sheet appropriate for each game.
